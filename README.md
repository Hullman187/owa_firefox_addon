Outlook Web App Notifications - firefox extension
=================

Firefox extension that adds system notifications capability to OWA (Outlook Web App).

You must be logged in OWA in order for this to work. No configuration needed.

How it works: when new email arrives into OWA a system notification about this event will be shown.
Also the fav icon and document title of the OWA tab will be updated to show the number of unread emails (so this also works with pinned tabs).

Fork of [OWA_firefox_addon by Phil Baranovskiy](https://github.com/rockfield/owa_firefox_addon).

Ready to install assemblies associated with releases (see builds folder).
